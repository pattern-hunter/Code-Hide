Code-Hide
=========

If you're unable to create an executable and want to run software/code directly using the code file but don't want the user to be able to see the code, this utility will encrypt and decrypt the code for you based on shift cypher. You decide by how much to shift, so decryption also becomes easy. Just enter the file name and you're good to go!
